# Krypton Suite of .NET WinForms Controls

The Kryton Suite of .NET WinForms controls are now freely available for use in personal or commerical projects. 

I developed and sold them from my company Component Factory from 2006 until 2014, when the lack sales meant that selling the controls was no longer viable. So I decided to make them open source so that .NET developers, hobby developers in particular, had a good set of free controls to use in their projects. However, they are free to use in commerical projects as well.

Full source code for all the controls and components is included along with Visual Studio 2015 projects and solution files.

The **Bin** directory contains already compiled copies of all the example projects and the Krypton assemblies, so you can quickly play around and explore the available controls. You can directly include the Krypton assemblies from the that directory into your projects.

Alternatively the **Source** directory contains the full source code that you can view, modify and directly compile.

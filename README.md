# Krypton Suite of .NET WinForms Controls

The Kryton Suite of .NET WinForms controls are now freely available for use in personal or commerical projects. I developed and sold them from my company Component Factory until 2014 when the lack sales meant that selling the controls no longer made sense.

Full source code for all the controls and components is included along with Visual Studio project and solution files for 2005, 2008 and 2010 versions of Visual Studio. If you are using a newer version of Visual Studio you can still load the solutions and it will compile just fine.

The **Bin** directory contains already compiled copies of all the example projects and the Krypton assemblies so you can quickly play around and explore the available controls. You can directly include the Krypton assemblies from the that directory into your projects. Alternatively the **Source** directory contains the full source code that you can view, modify and directly compile. For quick use you should download the **KryptonSource440.zip** file which contains an installer. It will install the samples and source code.

# Krypton Suite of .NET WinForms Controls

The Kryton Suite of .NET WinForms controls are now freely available for use in personal or commerical projects. I developed and sold them from my company Component Factory until 2014 when the lack sales meant that selling the controls no longer made sense.

So instead I have now made them freely available to any .NET WinForms developer than can make use of them. Full source code for all the controls and components is included along with Visual Studio project and solution files for 2005, 2008 and 2010 versions of Visual Studio. If you are using a newer version of Visual Studio you can still load the solutions and it will compile just fine.
